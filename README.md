# PythonPasswordManager
A Password Manager made entirely in Pyton

This is a full Password Manager made in python using basic concepts and libraries

To install simply download all files (main.py, Lib(db_manager.py, gui.py)) and put them into a directory like shown. 

I have tested the function on windows and linux but I do not have a way to test it on MacOS, while this should work on a Mac, you may need to change the default install location in the db_manager.py script.

I can add more features if anyone would like to make a suggestion, but this was just for fun and proof and concept.
